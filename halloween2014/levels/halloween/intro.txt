 Or maybe not?

	In celebration of Halloween Penny had
	prepared a little party for Tux. After he
	received the invitation, he hoped on his
	boat and traveled to the Halloween island.

	Arriving there he however finds to his
	dismey the party location empty and
	abandoned. So no party for him?

	After a moment of distress he collects
	himself and starts to think again. Not
	long after he remembers that there was
	another house on this forsake island and
	his invitation even tells him that the
	party is supposed to happen at east house,
	not the west one.

	With the confusion cleared up, Tux turns
	around and prepare himself for the journey
	across this dangerous island...") )
