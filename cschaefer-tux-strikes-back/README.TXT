Introduction
------------

Welcome to Tux Strikes Back! This is a level set for the
popular open source jump'n run game SuperTux v0.1.3.

I created this set mainly because of my interest in game
design. Another reason is that I didn't really like most
of SuperTux's original levels.



The Story
---------

One day, Tux finds a note from his arch enemy Nolok lying
in front of his igloo.

"Tux, your world is about to die!", the note reads. "I have
built a lava powered machine, hidden somewhere in Antarctica.
It will make your beloved ice melt. Don't even bother, you
have no chance to stop me. Haha! Signed, Nolok".

Tux is shocked. Now it's up to him to save Antarctica. He has
to find Nolok's machine and turn it off before it's too late.

The quest begins...



Requirements
------------

In order to play Tux Strikes Back, you'll need a copy of
SuperTux v0.1.3 (Milestone 1).

You can get SuperTux for your platform (Windows, Linux,
Macintosh and many others) from this URL:

http://supertux.lethargik.org

Attention: This level set will NOT work properly or at
all with earlier and later versions of SuperTux.



Installation
------------

There are three simple steps to install Tux Strikes Back.
Depending on your platform, replace "\" with "/".

1. Copy the directory "tsb" into your "SuperTux\data\levels"
directory (make sure to copy the whole directory/folder,
not just its content).

2. Now copy "tsb.stwm" (just the single file) into your
"SuperTux\data\levels\worldmaps" directory.

3. Finally copy "extro-tsb.txt" (again, just the single
file) into your "SuperTux\data" directory - that's it!



Usage
-----

Run SuperTux, at the main screen select "Bonus Levels" and
then "Tux Strikes Back". Have fun!
