"	...as Tux destroys the ice melting
	machine, his eyes capture a shadow
	in the distant, quickly vanishing
	into the darkness...


	His arch enemy Nolok has managed to
	escape once again...


	Tux knows that evil will return to
	Antarctica someday, as he starts his
	journey back home...
	

	However, he promises to himself
	to be there and defend his world
	whenever it will be needed...
